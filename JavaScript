Main elements : 

Components, Props, JSX

Components : - Data, logic and Apperance
    React app are entirely made of components like building block of UI.
    We build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them.
    Components can be reused, nested inside each other and pass data between them.

JSX : - JavaScript, CSS and HTML
    Declarative syntax to describe whata component look like and how they work
    Components must return a block of JSX
    Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement function call.
